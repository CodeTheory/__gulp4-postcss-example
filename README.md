A PostCSS / Gulp 4 / ES2015 Example Repo
--

This repo is here to show off the brilliant the technology we're able to use today, if only a minor amount of it. 

Please feel free to use any of this code on your own system. This repo is a way for me to contribute to the wonderful community that exists through open source code. Thank you to all those that also contribute!

### Installation

```
Requirments:
----
gulp-cli version 1.1.0
node v4 
```

First off, you'll need to install the modules from npm, so run `npm install`.
After that you're pretty much good to go. Play around with the files in the `src` directory and run `gulp` to build and watch the files you're changing.

If you want to build the files without the watch task, you can run `gulp dist`.
To find all of the tasks available, run `gulp --tasks` via gulp-cli.


### Contributions
Any and all help will be appreciated here. The goal here is to provide an example of how Gulp 4 / ES2015 and PostCSS can be used together now and not just in the future. 
If you have anything to contribute, please submit a pull request!



### Todo
- Write a more detailed README, listing the modules used and what they're for.
- Create a markup file using styles processed through the PostCSS/Gulp build system.
- Investigate more PostCSS modules that may be useful to the build process.
